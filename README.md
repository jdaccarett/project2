Project 2: Coin Change

Members: Andrew Kim, Juan Daccarett, Gillian Ayers,  Jacqueline Francik 

The three solution algorithms can be found in the following files written in Python.

Algorithm 1: Brute Force

	algo1.py

Algorithm 2: Greedy

	algo2.py

Algorithm 3: Dynamic Programming

	algo3.py

The file "WriteOuput.py" writes the input from the file at "Amount.txt" and writes the 
output to "[input filename]change.txt" in the following format:

Algorithm changeslow:

To run WriteOutput.py, type the following into the terminal: python WriteOutput.py

The file "testalgos.py" prints the test results using the test cases found in the project prompt. 
To run testalgos.py type the following into the terminal: python testalgos.py
